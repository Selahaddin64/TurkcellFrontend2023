                            </h3>
                            <p>To start your journey toward becoming a Motorcycle Club President, acquire a Clubhouse
                                through the Maze Bank Foreclosures website on your iFruit. Once you’ve chosen your
                                Clubhouse’s location, you can customize it to your liking, choose a club emblem, and
                                decide on a name for your MC. You can add a Gun Locker to your Clubhouse to customize
                                your Weapon Loadouts, as well as a Custom Bike Shop to upgrade and customize your
                                personal motorcycles.

                                Once your Clubhouse is set up, register as an MC President by pulling up the Interaction
                                Menu, navigating to Motorcycle Club, and selecting Start a Motorcycle Club.</p>

                            <p>Your Clubhouse can store up to 10 personal motorcycles and an additional seven rides for your MC members. As President, you can request any owned motorcycles to be delivered to you instantly in Freemode via the Motorcycle Club President section of the Interaction Menu.

                                Each Clubhouse also contains a bar area where you and your members can get rowdy. Grab a drink from the bar, play some Darts, fire up the jukebox, or settle a score at the Arm Wrestling table.
                                
                                The Meeting Room is where you can bark orders at your Prospects and launch Clubhouse Contracts to take on some strong-arm consulting work for clients in need of muscle.
                                
                                In your office, you’ll find a laptop with access to The Open Road — this is where you’ll manage your various MC Businesses to make some serious green.</p>

                            </h3>
                            <p>Both Presidents and Road Captains can set a riding formation via the Interaction Menu. Riding in formation regenerates health, vehicle health, and armor all while traveling at the same speed as the formation leader. It also looks awesome.

                            <h3>Motorcycle Club Businesses
                            </h3>
                            <p>In your Clubhouse office, you’ll find a laptop that gives you unbridled access to The Open Road. This website allows you to acquire a number of illicit businesses. Once a business is stocked up on supplies, it will begin accumulating product over time.

                                Keep a close eye on your businesses. You may sometimes be subject to police raids or other attacks, in which case you’ll need to defend your product.
                                
                                There are five businesses available, each with their own locations to choose from:

                                <ul>
                                    <li><p>                                Weed Farm
                                    </p></li>
                                    <li><p>                                Counterfeit Cash Factory
                                    </p></li>
                                    <li><p>                                Document Forgery Office
                                    </p></li>
                                    <li><p>                                Cocaine Lockup
                                    </p></li>
                                    <li><p>                                Methamphetamine Lab
                                    </p></li>
                                </ul>
                                Once purchased and the initial setup mission is completed, ride over to your business and use its laptop to upgrade staff, equipment, and security. When you’re ready, trade your goods for a profit by launching a Sell Mission with your Prospects in tow.</p>

                            </h3>
                            <p>You can head to the meeting room within your Clubhouse to launch Clubhouse Contracts — Freemode missions for you and your MC members to earn some tidy GTA$ and RP through a range of noble deeds — from the forceful liberation of your falsely incarcerated allies to good old-fashioned gunrunning. 
                                
                            </p>

                                There are 11 missions total, but only three will be available at a time, rotating periodically.</p>
